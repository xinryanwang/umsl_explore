      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        The UMSL Exploring Engineering Day on November 8, 2025, from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. will
        highlight the strengths and opportunities within UMSL Engineering and its joint
        engineering programs with Washington University in St. Louis. The event is designed to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce prospective students, families, and educators to UMSL’s high-quality, affordable engineering pathways.</li>
        <li>Showcase UMSL Engineering’s hands-on learning environment, access to state-of-the-art labs, and strong connections to industry and research opportunities.</li>
        <li>Highlight the collaborative faculty expertise and supportive community that help students thrive academically and professionally.</li>
        <li>Provide interactive activities, demonstrations, and conversations with faculty, current students, and alumni that reflect the innovation-driven spirit of UMSL Engineering.</li>
        <li>Emphasize the university’s role in preparing graduates to become leaders and problem-solvers in a wide range of engineering fields.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By the end of the event, attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the value of
        pursuing an engineering degree at UMSL, the unique benefits of its partnerships, and the
        career possibilities awaiting UMSL Engineering graduates.
